PhD Friends!
============

This is a simple game in Node.js + JS for learning the names of
the research students in the Geoscience department.

Given a friendly face, try to guess the friendly name!

This game works by scraping pages from the Geoscience site.
There is some caching implemented to try and minimize blasting the
Geoscience servers with unnecessary requests, but these caches do need to be
filled at some stage, and images are still loaded from the
Geoscience servers.
If the game is running slowly, it is probably because the Geoscience
servers are running slowly!
